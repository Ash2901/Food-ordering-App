	1. What are the various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.
		a. There are two ways to add images in React app. Either we can use CDN links and provide different IDs or we can directly use links to render images. 
		b. First way is to store the CDN Url and then provide different Ids in the img tag to render the image. 
			import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/consts"; 
			<img 
			alt="restaurant Logo" 
			src={CDN_URL + cloudinaryImageId} 
			className="res-logo" 
			/>
			
		c. Second way is to directly import images which are stored in our local project. 
			import { Logo } from "../utils/img/Logo.png"; 
			<img 
			alt="restaurant Logo" 
			src={Logo} 
			className="res-logo" 
			/>
		
	2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
		a. When we do console.log(useState()), if gives us an array with two elements where first element will be undefined as we havenâ€™t provided any default value. The second element of the array is the function for changing the value of state variable. 
		
	3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
		a. If we don't add dependency array then useEffect() will be called every time when page reloads.
		b. i.e it will execute callback function on every rerender.
		
	4. What is SPA?
		a. Single Page Application. SPA is a web application which renders different components based on the URL. When we change the URL, only the component which is rendered is changed and the browser does not refresh the page when the URL is changed unlike traditional websites.
		
	5. What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
		a. Server Side Rendering: When the request is made, the server fetches the webpage which is supposed to be rendered for the particular URL and it replaces the newer fetched webpage with older one. 
		b. Client Side Rendering: For client side rendering, minimal code is sent from the request and the code is expanded to render different components based on the URL. All single page applications are mostly client side rendering. In Client side rendering the router library navigates the user to new page without sending a request to the backend.
